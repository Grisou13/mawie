    Asynchronous download from network, which is expected to be unreliable and possibly slow.

    Qt docs: 'One QNetworkAccessManager should be enough for the whole Qt application.'
    Similarly, one DownLoader might be enought for the whole app.
    It is untested what happens when you create more than one.

    Usage:

      foo = Downloader(url)
      foo.downloaded.connect(clientLoader)

      foo.doDownload(QUrl('http:/...'))
      # execution continues, clientLoader slot will receive signal
