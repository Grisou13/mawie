## Why python?

Pyton is one of technologies that you hear myths about, and always want to test. This is the perfect way to test alot of functionnality from it. From database queries, to handling files, and having a gui application behind.

Python was used, because we knew it would fit our needs and even more. We were able to achieve a good balance between readable code, and efficient code, and all that thanks to python builtins, and simple module system.
