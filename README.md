# What is this all about

Pyton is one of technologies that you hear myths about, and always want to test. This is the perfect way to test alot of functionnality from it. From database queries, to handling files, and having a gui application behind.

Python was used, because we knew it would fit our needs and even more. We were able to achieve a good balance between readable code, and efficient code, and all that thanks to python builtins, and simple module system.

# Installation Guide

Requirements :
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/) 3.5.2
- [pip](https://packaging.python.org/installing/#install-pip-setuptools-and-wheel) 9.0.1 or greater

First, install the sources of the project
```
git clone https://github.com/Grisou13/mawie.git && cd mawie
```

In the cloned folder, install the requirements with pip.
(if you have many versions of python installed, use "pyton3.5 -m pip" to assure that you use pip that correspont to the good version).
```
python3.5 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And to start the app simply
```
python3.5 mawie
```

Easy, huh ?

Refactor and add relative imports, sintead of this horrible sys.path.extend
UZse asyncrounous coroutines to boost app performance (Quamash, Eventloops, or pure python async)
